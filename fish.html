Bringing fish into your home can be an exciting hobby, especially if you intend to breed them, and the presence of a fish tank in your home can induce feelings of peace and tranquility.<br>
    Whether you are bringing your fish home for the first time or maintaining your aquarium, it is important to test your water <b>once per week</b> to ensure it is free from toxins that can harm your fish.<br>

      <li>Ammonia: any level above 0.1 ppm requires attention</li>
      <li>Nitrates: 10 to 40 ppm</li>
