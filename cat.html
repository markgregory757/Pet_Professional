    <h1>CATS</h1>
    
    <h3>
      Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region
      and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the United
      States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and
      diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and practices are
      generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family member
      regardless of breed.

      <strong>Zero to Four Weeks</strong><br>  It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a
      female cat that is either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if
      possible. Monitor your kitten’s growth closely to make sure its growth
      rate is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient
      rate, a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly either with a
      bottle or a feeding tube. Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight
      appropriately include the following: • too many other siblings are
      competing for mom's milk • gastrointestinal disease • environmental
      conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions

      <strong>Four Weeks to One Year</strong><br>  Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet
      kitten food typically around three to four weeks after birth. According to
      the ASPCA, kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten
      food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has
      difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of water can be added to
      soften the food. Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the
      additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness.
      Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary requirements.
      You should always consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.

      <strong>One Year to Seven Years</strong><br>  This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and
      do not need as many nutrients. At this age, their level of activity
      decreases, and so does their metabolism. It is not recommended to leave
      food out for the cats all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day
      so they eat meals rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice
      reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.

      <strong>Seven Years and More</strong><br>  Much like many living organisms, the body begins to
      deteriorate and experience a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat
      less fats and calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are
      purchasing packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a
      particular protein (such as "salmon") and not just a category (such as
      fish). This usually means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser
      quality proteins.
